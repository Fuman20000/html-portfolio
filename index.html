<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>

<p>Welccome to my first ever HTML website I've made from scratch! Down below, you'll see some links to 
   some of my pages. Think of this as my personal blog. This website is essentially bare bones when it 
   comes to making a website, similar to Craigslist and that's why it looks like a website from the 90's. 
   Feel free to browse around!
