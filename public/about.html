<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Elliote Willis and welcome to my first ever HTML website. This is a technical project of mine to display
  my writing HTML. Before this, I had very minor experience with HTML. When I was in high school, I took courses that
  focused on computer science and I really enjoyed it and decided to continue educating myself on how to write code 
  and making websites.
