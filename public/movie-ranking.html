<h1>Elliote's Must See Movies</h1>
<h2>My recomendations for action/suspense movies</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Heat</h3>
 <p>Heat is easily one of Michael Mann's best work and one of the best action and drama films of the 90's. It's filled with A list actors who give excellent performances, paired with 
   one of the most most recognizable locations in movies, Los Angeles. The cinematography is excellent and really captures the emotions Michael Mann wants you to feel.
   Also, there's no use of CGI or computer animation, so all of the action scenes are all created by practical effects and blank firing weapons. The soundtrack is excellent as well and plays a part
   in brining scenes together. This film is a masterpiece.</p>

<h3>Gran Turismo</h3>
 <p>I'll admit, I was skeptical about this movie because it's technically based on a videogame, so I had questions on how would this would translate in the real world. By the end of the 
   movie, I was pleasantly surprised with how great the movie was. It had drama, suspense, and could make you happy and sad. Needless to say, this is one of the best films of the year.</p> 

   <h3>Collateral</h3>
<p>Collateral is another well regarded film from Michael Mann. You can tell Michael Mann loves using Los Angeles as a setting in his films because this is his second time using it. Heat was about 
   a suspense thriller between a group of robbers and detectives and this is about a cab driver in LA and a hitman who's just doing what he's paid to do. To me, the movie captures Los Angeles very well
   as it captures various parts of the city. This movie also has several A list actors like Tom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, and Jada Pinkett Smith. The soundtrack paired with the grit of Los Angeles and scenes
   make this one of my favorite movies.
